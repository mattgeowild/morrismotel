<Page title="Privacy">
	<p>Like any good motel, here at Morris Motel, discretion is our middle name. We believe privacy is a fundamental human right. We also believe privacy policies shouldn't require a team of lawyers to decipher, so here's how we operate:</p><p>We do not collect any of your data without your consent. We do not host advertisements.</p><p>We use a small, privacy-respecting analytics engine called Plausible Analytics, which counts site views and a few other details. This does not store any information (cookies) in your browser, nor does it collect IP addresses or any other identifiers. It also does not track across devices, websites, or apps. Our full analytics can be found at <a href="https://plausible.io/morrismotel.com">https://plausible.io/morrismotel.com</a>. You can also review the <a href="https://plausible.io/privacy" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plausible Analytics Privacy Policy</a> and the <a href="https://plausible.io/data-policy" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plausible Analytics Data Policy</a>. You can opt-out of analytics by blocking the plausible.io domain through a blocker extension (uBlock Origin, for example) or via firewall, pihole, etc.</p><p>If you contact us directly via email, the information we receive is at your discretion. We may also receive your name attached to the email, depending on how your email provider is set up. If you instead choose to fill out a contact form to reach us, the only thing sent to us is the contents of the form. All forms are end-to-end encrypted.</p><p>If you have any questions, feel free to send us an email at <a>contact@morrismotel.com</a>.</p>
